# grizzly-genetics-analysis

Preliminary genetic comparison between Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and Glacier-Bob Marshall (GBM) grizzly bear populations.

This project aims to establish a reproducible workflow for assessing genetic differentiation between the two isolated grizzly bear populations using microsatellite data. The goal is to calculate genetic divergence metrics (e.g., Fst) to quantify the level of isolation between GYE and GBM populations, providing insights for conservation genetics.
